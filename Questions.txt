Experience:

During this test I had different challenges that allowed me to learn but also want to know more about the subject, document myself and know a little more about the language used when creating a payment gateway.
It was an enriching experience where I hope to continue learning in order to have solid knowledge.
I have worked with services for different companies but always focused on artificial intelligence, I find it very interesting to gain experience in services focused on transactions. I feel that this is a market that is constantly growing and has a lot to work on.
